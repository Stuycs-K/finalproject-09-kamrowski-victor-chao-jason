### 2025-05-19 - Algorithm Research and Next Steps
**In Class**  
 - Found reference articles detailing the MD5 algorithm steps.
 - Created files that contain each individual step, and then a Main that combines it all together.
**At Home**
 - Read the rest of the in-depth article on MD5.

### 2025-05-20 - K Constants
**In Class**  
 - Read the "geeksforgeeks" article. Did not really learn much.
 - Read the Wikipedia article, mainly paying attention to the pseudocode provided.
 - Began testing ways to store K values for the algorithm.
 - Created a `Test.java` file for making helper functions in `Utils.java`.

### 2025-05-21 - K Constants (continued)
**In Class**  
 - Settled on storing K values as a set of strings in hexadecimal format.
 - Created a helper function that creates a 2D array of Bytes by translating the hex strings.

### 2025-05-23 - K Constants Completed + Starting S Constants
**In Class**  
 - Completed a helper function. Returns a 2D array of Bytes of size 64x4.
 - Started creation of S Constants array.

### 2024-01-03 - Brief description
